# Simple Colugo:
A toolkit that aims to make Binance automation easier, especially for the average trader that doesn't know how to code.
## Getting Started:
1.  Login to Binance and create and collect your API keys.
2.  Open Config.py with your favorite text editor and add your API keys accordingly.
3.  While your inside of config.py you'll probably notice the varirable **testing**, and that it's set to True. Leaving this as-is will prevent the bot from placing orders, meaning when you're ready to go live, you'll need to change this variable to **True**.

## Running an example strategy:
1. Go to the folder containing the strategy and copy the strategy path that you'd like to run.
2. Go to your terminal and type:

        python PASTE_STRAT_PATH_HERE
